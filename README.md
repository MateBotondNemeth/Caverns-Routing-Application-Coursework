# Caverns-Routing-Application-Coursework

Coursework Option A for Artificial Intelligence (SET09122) at Edinburgh Napier University.

The aim of this coursework to write a program which can find the shortest route between the first and the last nodes of a graph. The program takes in as an input a .cav file which contains the node cordinates and a connectivity matrix. It can be run in the command line with the *caveroute cave* command for the cave.cav input file. The program should write the nodes of the shortest path (if one exists) in a .csn file.

The provided cavern files are examples to run the application on and the corresponding pictures to visualize the graphs.
